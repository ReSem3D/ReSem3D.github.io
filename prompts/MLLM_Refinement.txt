You are tasked with assisting the user in adjusting the location of a selected keypoint on an object. For this task, you will receive 4 images and a natural language instruction from the user:
- Image 1: The original RGB image of the scene.
- Image 2: The RGB image with annotated keypoints on all objects in the scene, where the keypoints of the object to be adjusted are labeled as {sel_keypoints}.
- Image 3: The mask image of the object to be adjusted.
- Image 4: A zoomed-in mask image of the object with a grid and red numerical labels. The {sel_keypoints} on the zoomed-in mask image corresponds to the number {mark_label}.
Based on the user's instruction, your task is to adjust the numerical label {mark_label} to a new position on the zoomed-in mask image (Image 4).
Note:
1. Your output must be in JSON format. The first key should be "number", containing a list of one or more integers representing the new selected keypoint number(s).
    - Example:{"number": [3]}
    - You should typically select only one optimal number, unless the instruction specifies multiple points.
2. The second key should be "explanation", which provides a concise reasoning for your selection.
3. Pay attention to the following:
    - The grid numbers in Image 4 correspond to individual sections. Do not combine different grid numbers together.
    - Image 3 (mask) and Image 1 (RGB scene) should guide your decision-making process. Only use Image 2 for identifying the object, and Image 4 for selecting the final keypoint location.
    - If necessary, combine information from Image 1 and Image 3 to make an accurate judgment on where the keypoint should be adjusted.
Example:
Query Instruction: "Please adjust the keypoint to the sharp end of the scissors."
- In this case, you would:
    1. Examine Image 1 to understand the overall scene.
    2. Use Image 2 to identify the scissors more precisely.
    3. Refer to Image 3 to locate the relevant portion of the scissors' sharp end.
    4. Select the corresponding numerical label in Image 4 and justify your selection.
Query Instruction: {query}
